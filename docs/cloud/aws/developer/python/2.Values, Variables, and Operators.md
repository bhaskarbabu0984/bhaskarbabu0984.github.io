# 2. Values, Variables, and Operators

 
## Variables
A variable is a container for storing data values. You use variables to store information that Python can reference and use. Instead of using a number or string directly, you can use a variable instead. Variables could be any number of things, such as a string of text, a list, or an object. Using variables makes your code flexible and reusable. Variable names are defined when you declare them, and they need to follow these rules:
- They can have letters, digits, and underscores
- They cannot have whitespace and symbols such as + and -, !, @, $, #, %
- They must start with a letter or the underscore character
- They cannot start with a number
- They cannot be a Python keyword
  

> **Important Note:**
>
> Variable names are case-sensitive. For example, variable a and variable A are two different variables.


In the following code example, the first line declares a variable named x and assigns the integer value of 3 to it. The second line declares a variable named y and assigns the string value "John" to it. The code then prints the values of variables x and y.

```
x = 3
y = "John"

print(x)
print(y)

```


## Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. To learn more about the basic operators in Python, choose each of the numbered markers. You will explore and experiment with these operators throughout this module.

![Operators](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73ee073b-dd6a-4a9f-bb85-f6ccd41e3c33)

- Assignment: Use assignment operators to assign values to variables. The basic assignment operator (=) assigns the value on its right side to the variable on its left side.
There are other assignment operators that combine a special symbol with the equals character. They are called augmented assignment operators and they represent shorthands for performing an operation on the variable on the left. For example "+=" adds the value on the right to the variable on the left.

- Arithmetic: Use arithmetic operators to perform math operations on numeric values. Arithmetic operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), modulus (%), exponentiation (**), division (/), and floor division (//). 

- Comparison: Use comparison operators to compare values. Comparison operators include equal (==), not equal (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).

- Logical: Use logical operators to combine conditional statements. Logical operators include and, or, and not.


### Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. Python provides two forms of assignment operators: basic assignment operators and augmented assignment operators., You have seen examples of the basic assignment operator = in the previous section where you assigned an integer value and a string value to variables. An augmented assignment operator provides a shorthand way to perform an operation and assign the result to the variable on the left side of the operator in one step.

For example, in the following code, x = 5 assigns the value of 5 to the variable x.

Variables can also be used to assign new values to other variables, as shown in x =  x * 3. The following line, print(x), prints the value of x to the console in your IDE. The expected value is 15, which is the product of 5 multiplied by 3.

The next line of code, x *= 3, then multiples the current value of x, which is now 15, by 3, using the multiplication assignment operator *= (where * is the multiplication operator). This augmented assignment operator provides a shorthand for the equivalent statement of x = x * 3.

The final line of code prints the new value of x, which is 45, using the print() function. 

```
# The assignment operator assigns a value to a variable
x = 5 

# Variables can be assigned a new value (x is updated to x * 3, or 15)
x = x * 3
print(x) # Expected output: 15

# The following is shorthand for x = x * 3
x *= 3
print(x) # Expected output: 45

```

### Arithmetic operators 
In Python, you can use the following characters to perform arithmetic operations in your code.

| Operation | Symbol | Definition | Example |
|:----------:|:----------:|----------|:----------:|
| Addition | + | Adds two numbers | 8 + 3 → 11 |
| Subtraction | - | Subtracts one number from another | 15 - 7 → 8 |
| Multiplication | * | Multiplies two numbers | 6 * 4 → 24 |
| Division | / | Divides one number by another and includes decimals in the result | 14 / 3 → 4.666... |
| Floor division | // | Divides one number by another and removes the decimal part, keeping only the whole number | 14 / 3 → 4 |
| Modulus | % | Returns the remainder of a division operation | 25 % 6 → 1 (25 divided by 6 equals 4, with a remainder of 1) |
| Exponentiation | ** | Raises one number to the power of another | 3 ** 4 → 81 (3 raised to the power of 4 is 3*3*3*3)|

The following code provides an example of using the addition operator in Python. It uses the variables x and y, which have been assigned the values of 10 and 5, respectively. The result of adding them with + is printed to the console. The expected output is 15.

```
x = 10
y = 5

print(x+y)

```

### Comparison operators
In Python, you can use comparison operators to compare values and return a Boolean result: True or False. The following table summarizes some of the comparison operators in Python.

| Operator | Definition | Example | 
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| == | Equal to | 3 == 3 → True <br> 4 == 3 → False |
| != | Not equal to | "hello" != "world" → True <br> "hello" != "hello" → False |
| > | Greater than | 4 > 3 → True <br> 1 > 10 → False |
| < | Less than | 3 < 4 → True <br> 99 < 1 → False |
| >= | Greater than or equal to | 3 >= 1 → True <br> 2 >= 3 → False |
| <= | Less than or equal to | 3 <= 4 → True <br> 99 <= 1 → False |

```
# Define two variables x and y
x = 5  # First number
y = 8  # Second number

# Equality Operator (==)
# Checks if x is equal to y and returns True if they are the same, otherwise False
print(x == y)  # Output: False (x is not equal to y)

# Greater Than Operator (>)
# Checks if x is greater than y and returns True if it is, otherwise False
print(x > y)  # Output: False (5 is not greater than 8)

# Less Than or Equal To Operator (<=)
# Checks if x is less than or equal to y and returns True if it is, otherwise False
print(x <= y)  # Output: True (5 is less than 8, so it’s True)
# Greater Than or Equal To Operator (>=)
# Checks if x is greater than or equal to y and returns True if it is, otherwise False
print(x >= y)  # Output: False (5 is not greater than or equal to 8)

# Not Equal To Operator (!=)
# Checks if x is not equal to y and returns True if they are different, otherwise False
print(x != y)  # Output: True (x is not equal to y)

```
## Operators precedence
Operator precedence describes the order in which Python performs operations. Operator precedence in Python follows the PEMDAS rule.
- P - Parentheses
- E - Exponentiation
- M – Multiplication and D – Division
- A – Addition and S – Subtraction
  
If multiple operators in the same expression share the same precedence, they are generally performed in order from left to right.

To practice the concept of operator precedence, complete the following code steps with the code block that follows.
1. Use the Copy code button to copy the following code and paste it into a Python file in your IDE.
2. Before running it, predict what will print.
3. Run the file afterwards to verify your prediction. In this example, because parenthesis have the highest precedence, they are evaluated first.
4. Try removing the parenthesis enclosing the two 20 + 10 operations. What are the results, and why?

```
print((20 + 10) - (20 +10))

```
