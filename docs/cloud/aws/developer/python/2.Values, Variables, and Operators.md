# 2. Values, Variables, and Operators

 
## Variables
A variable is a container for storing data values. You use variables to store information that Python can reference and use. Instead of using a number or string directly, you can use a variable instead. Variables could be any number of things, such as a string of text, a list, or an object. Using variables makes your code flexible and reusable. Variable names are defined when you declare them, and they need to follow these rules:
- They can have letters, digits, and underscores
- They cannot have whitespace and symbols such as + and -, !, @, $, #, %
- They must start with a letter or the underscore character
- They cannot start with a number
- They cannot be a Python keyword
  

> **Important Note:**
>
> Variable names are case-sensitive. For example, variable a and variable A are two different variables.

In the following code example, the first line declares a variable named x and assigns the integer value of 3 to it. The second line declares a variable named y and assigns the string value "John" to it. The code then prints the values of variables x and y.

```
x = 3
y = "John"

print(x)
print(y)

```

## Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. To learn more about the basic operators in Python, choose each of the numbered markers. You will explore and experiment with these operators throughout this module.
