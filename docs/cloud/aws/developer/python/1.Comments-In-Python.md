# Comments

## Comments in Python

Comments in Python are essential for code readability and documentation. They allow you to explain your code's purpose, functionality, and decision-making process. Use comments to clarify complex logic, document functions, or provide context.

In Python, you can create single-line comments with # (pound symbol) or multi-line comments using triple quotes (''' or """). Here's an example that demonstrates both types of comments.

```
# This is a single-line comment

print("Hello, World!") 

# This comment is at the end of a line of code

""" 
This is a multi-line comment. 
It can span several lines. 
Use it for longer explanations. 
"""

print("This line comes after the multi-line comment") 
print("Python ignores comments when running the code") 
# print("This line won't be executed because it's commented out") ```
