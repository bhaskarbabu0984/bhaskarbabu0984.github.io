# Introduction

This module introduces cloud architecture principles. To take advantage of a cloud infrastructure for your business, while complying with the AWS Well-Architected Framework, you should know these principles.

Applying these cloud principles will help you to build highly available, scalable architectures within AWS. The cloud principles are as follows:

- Designing for failure
- Decoupled components instead of monolithic architecture
- Implementing elasticity in the cloud as opposed to on-premises environments
- Thinking parallel
